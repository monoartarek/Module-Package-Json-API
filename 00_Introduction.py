#What is Module?
#In programming, a module is a file that contains code (like functions, classes, or variables) that can be reused in other programs. Think of a module as a toolbox: it groups related tools (code) together so you can import and use them when needed.A module is simply a .py file.

# example:
# 🔎 Built-in Python Modules (already included with Python):
# math – for mathematical functions

# datetime – for date/time handling

# random – for random number generation

# os – for interacting with the operating system


#what is package?
#In programming, especially in languages like Python, a package is a collection of modules organized in a folder.

#🔑 Key Difference:
# A module is a single .py file.

# A package is a folder that contains one or more modules (and often a special file called __init__.py).
# my_package/
# ├── __init__.py
# ├── math_utils.py
# └── string_utils.py


# 🛠️ Real-world Examples in Python:
# numpy – a package for numerical computations

# pandas – a package for data analysis

# flask – a package for building web apps

# Each of these packages contains many modules inside.
